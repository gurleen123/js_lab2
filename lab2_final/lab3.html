  <h1> Lab 3 - All About Events </h1>
  <p>
  
  Events are any number of things that can happen inside a browser â€“ from the user resizing the document window, certain content being scrolled, or even a video reaching the end of the clip. There are a huge number of events that can be listened for in your code, and for each one, a corresponding action can be taken.
